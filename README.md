# PartCHOI: PartCHOI: Part-Aware Guidance for Clothed Human-Object Interaction Generation

A part-aware method for single-view 3D clothed human–object interaction (CHOI) generation. Our
approach achieves plausible layouts and natural contacts in image-to-CHOI scenes, generates realistic scenes with complex interaction semantics from text prompts, and supports diverse interactive extensions.


## Code will be released upon paper acceptance.
